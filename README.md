# react-redux-sage-typescript-starter
This is my personal starter for SPA development.

### General Philosophies
1. Favor small projects over large ones
1. Focus on developer productivity
1. Testing is a must
1. Code should be clean
1. Give a starting point, but make it bare bones and hackable

### Goals
Ideally, this will end up being a generator or some kind -either through something like yeoman or something akin to angular-cli.
In the mean time, it is going to be clone/checkout based.

Here are some of the requirements I have for an MVP. I add more as I think of them.
