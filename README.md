# react-redux-saga-typescript-starter
This is my personal starter for SPA development. It's a bare bones starter meant to be hacked.
Perhaps in the future I will provide branches/forks/whatever for more full-featured applications
based on this starter.

### Goals
Ideally, this will end up being a generator or some kind -either through something like yeoman or something akin to angular-cli.
In the mean time, it is going to be clone/checkout based.

Here are some of the requirements I have for an MVP. I add more as I think of them.

- [x] First class support for testing
    - [x] unit tests
    - [x] e2e tests
    - [x] coverage
    - [x] fast tests
- [x] Easy development
    - [x] seemless debugging
    - [x] hot module loading
    - [x] fast recompilation
    - [x] autogenerated documentation
    - [x] beautification
    - [x] dependency graph generation
    - [x] linting
    - [x] git hooks
    - [x] bundle analysis
- [x] Features
    - [x] router
    - [x] history
    - [x] admin panel
    - [x] authentication
    - [x] authorization
    - [x] logging
    - [x] animations
        - CSS
        - Greensock (imperative)
        - react-pose (declarative)
    - [x] webworkers
    - [x] metrics

### Technologies
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] react
- [x] react-redux
- [x] redux-saga
- [x] webpack
- [x] babel
- [x] tslint
- [x] storybook
- [x] sass
- [x] gsap
- [x] react-pose

### Ideas
 - Dependency injection
    - is it needed? HoC might be more appropriate for a dynamic language
 - Use declaration files to put web workers in .ts files
 - Investigate if it is worth while to try to get something like worker-loader working
 - Google Analytics/Universal Analytics
 - GraphQL?
    - might be over kill for this project
