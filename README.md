# react-starter
This is my personal starter for SPA development. It's a bare bones starter meant to be hacked.
Perhaps in the future I will provide branches/forks/whatever for more full-featured applications
based on this starter.

### Goals
Ideally, this will end up being a generator or some kind -either through something like yeoman or something akin to angular-cli.
In the mean time, it is going to be clone/checkout based.

Here are some of the requirements I have for an MVP. I add more as I think of them.

- [ ] First class support for testing
    - [ ] unit tests
    - [ ] e2e tests
    - [ ] coverage
    - [ ] fast tests
    - [ ] snapshot testing
- [ ] Easy development
    - [ ] seemless debugging
    - [ ] hot module loading
    - [ ] fast recompilation
    - [ ] autogenerated documentation
    - [ ] beautification
    - [ ] dependency graph generation
    - [ ] linting
    - [ ] git hooks
    - [ ] bundle analysis
    - [ ] .d.ts generation
- [ ] Features
    - [ ] router
    - [ ] history
    - [ ] admin panel

### Style Explanation
1. I prefer to split my application code along domain boundaries. This is opposed to
another popular style where you have directories for "types" of application pieces
e.g. /components, /services, /containers. I prefer this because I believe it fosters
good programming practice.
1. Unit Tests should live next to the files they test. When tests are in a complete separate
directory structure, it's very easy to forget to move the test when refactoring the location
of some domain code. Integration tests or e2e tests should live in a central location.
1. Files should follow a predictable naming convention. I prefer dot separated files of the form:
`domain.clarifier.sub-clarifier.ext` e.g. `auth.domain.ts`, `home.animation.banner.ts`
