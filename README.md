# react-redux-saga-typescript-starter
This is my personal starter for SPA development. It's a bare bones starter meant to be hacked.
Perhaps in the future I will provide branches/forks/whatever for more full-featured applications
based on this starter.

### Goals
Ideally, this will end up being a generator or some kind -either through something like yeoman or something akin to angular-cli.
In the mean time, it is going to be clone/checkout based.

Here are some of the requirements I have for an MVP. I add more as I think of them.

- [x] First class support for testing
    - [x] unit tests
    - [x] e2e tests
    - [x] coverage
    - [x] fast tests
- [x] Easy development
    - [x] seemless debugging
    - [x] hot module loading
    - [x] fast recompilation
    - [x] autogenerated documentation
    - [x] beautification
    - [x] dependency graph generation
    - [x] linting
    - [x] git hooks
    - [x] bundle analysis
    - [ ] .d.ts generation

### Style Explanation
1. I prefer to split my application code along domain boundaries. This is opposed to
another popular style where you have directories for "types" of application pieces
e.g. /components, /services, /containers. I prefer this because I believe it fosters
good programming practice.
1. Tests should live next to the files they test. When tests are in a complete separate
directory structure, it's very easy to forget to move the test when refactoring the location
of some domain code.
1. Files should follow a predictable naming convention. I prefer dot separated files of the form:
`domain.clarifier.sub-clarifier.ext` e.g. `auth.domain.ts`, `auth.user.service.ts`


### Ideas
 - Dependency injection
    - is it needed? HoC might be more appropriate for a dynamic language
 - Use declaration files to put web workers in .ts files
 - Investigate if it is worth while to try to get something like worker-loader working
 - Google Analytics/Universal Analytics
 - GraphQL?
    - might be over kill for this project
